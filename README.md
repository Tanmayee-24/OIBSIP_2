TRIBUTE PAGE
With a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, you can easily create a page for someone you admire. Write about what you adore in the person, add images, give an appealing layout, use paragraphs appropriately. You can also play around with different font styles and background colors.
Explanation of the role of HTML and CSS in designing the tribute page:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the backbone of the tribute page, providing the structure and content. It defines the layout of the page, including headings, paragraphs, images, and any other necessary elements. HTML ensures that the information about APJ Abdul Kalam is properly organized and presented to the viewer in a clear and logical manner.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS enhances the visual presentation of the tribute page. It allows for customization of the page's appearance, including colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design aesthetics. CSS ensures that the tribute page is visually appealing and cohesive, making it more engaging for the audience. Additionally, CSS helps in achieving responsiveness and ensuring that the page looks good on different devices and screen sizes, contributing to a better user experience.
